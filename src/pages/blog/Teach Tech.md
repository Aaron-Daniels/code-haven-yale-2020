This year, Code Haven once again hosted TeachTech - here's what we've been up to!

## What is Teach Tech?

Every year we host a conference for teachers in the New England area about how to implement computer science in their school's curriculum. This is our chance to share our experiences with teaching computer science in middle school classes across New Haven. Though we are by no means experts at teaching, we use this conference to demonstrate some of the programs, resources, and tricks that we find helpful when teaching computer science. The event consists of workshops, speakers, and time for networking to give teachers and administrators all of the tools they need to enhance or create the coding initiatives at their schools.
We covered all of the introductory aspects to teaching code, with a talk about fundamentals and a keynote address on the importance of computer science in early education. Every session was designed to get teachers more excited about teaching computer science in their classes. We'll detail more of the specific workshops we did later on in this post.


## Why do we host Teach Tech?

Even though Code Haven has gone from having 14 students in its program in 2017 to over 180 now in 2020, we can't reach every student. In order to help give more students access to computer science curriculum, we started Teach Tech 3 years ago. Many studies have found that students from low-income families and minority groups tend to have less access to any programming resources, which is why we wish to give faculty from other school districts and even other states the tools they need to integrate computer science into their school curriculum. We hope that by making computer science more accessible to students, we can help spark another generation of innovative thinkers who may be able to change the world for the better. Based on feedback from the conference attendees, every single attendee felt better equipped and more inspired to integrate computer science in their own schools to get kids excited about coding.
In addition to learning from our programming, the teachers were able to engage in important discussions with each other. Giving teachers from all over the area this space to learn from each other was amazing to witness, and we saw a lot of educators come away having made significant connections - we saw one teacher, who was trying to start a Girls Who Code chapter at her school, exchange contact info with a Girls Who Code organizer at a different school. Being able to facilitate those kinds of interactions proved to us that TeachTech did its job.


## Narrative of the Day

Teach Tech 2020 began with a hearty breakfast, courtesy of Panera Bread, and registration in the front lobby of 17 Hillhouse.
Maansi and Bernardo, the co-presidents of Code Haven, along with the events team set up a registration table and began distributing pamphlets, which contained an itinerary and a detailed overview of the day's workshops. The day's first event was a keynote given by Nathaniel Granor, a freelance technology consultant and experience designer at the forefront of the growth of computer science education in the northeastern United States. In The What and Why of Computer Science, he emphasized both the changing nature of technology and the increasing power and innovation that computer science can bring to not just technology, but to all other academic endeavors.
The next event on the list was Hello World!, an overview of coding fundamentals and how to teach them to middle school students. Gabe and David explained the importance of enthusiasm, having interactive activities, and reinforcing understanding through the use of live coding exercises and independent projects alike.
After this presentation, teachers could choose a different workshop for both of the sessions, including Scratch, Code.org, Google CS First, and Python Natural Language Processing… One of the most attended workshops was the Robotics workshop during which teachers learned how to use the Makeblock and Sphero robots that are easy and engaging ways to implement cs. In fact, after a quick introduction and review of the basics of these robots, teachers were given a chance to play around with the robots and test out the different functionalities.
Another popular workshop is on MIT App Inventor, which is a program (similar to Scratch) that allows students to make android apps that they can actually use on the phones we give them. During the school year, we dedicate half of the semester to let students work on creating their own app, and so in this workshop, we showed teachers how to use the program and how best to implement it. In order to best demonstrate the basics of MIT App Inventor, we allow teachers to test it out on their own laptops while we float around to answer any questions that may persist.
Finally, we hosted two workshops on Unplugged Activities, in which we demonstrated some of the ways we teach computer science to our students without computers. For example, on the very first day of class, we do a robot demonstration where one of our mentors pretends to be a robot, and the class must give them instructions on how to wrap a gift. Not only does this unplugged activity teach the kids how specific coding is, but it is also super engaging and gets them excited to learn about computer science.
