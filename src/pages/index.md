heading: Bringing Weekly CS Lessons to New Haven Classrooms
description: >-
  Introducing students to computing at a young age is important in developing
  interest in computer science. Many middle schools in New Haven donâ€™t have computer science programs. Yale has a wealth of computer science knowledge in its students, faculty, and resources. We want to combine the two worlds and increase interest and awareness of computer science in local schools.
