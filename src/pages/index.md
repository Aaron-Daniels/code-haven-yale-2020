title: Code Haven at Yale
heading: Bringing Weekly CS Lessons to New Haven Classrooms
description: >-
  Introducing students to computing at a young age is important in developing
  interest in computer science. Many middle schools in New Haven don’t have
  computer science programs. Yale has a wealth of computer science knowledge in
  its students, faculty, and resources. We want to combine the two worlds and
  increase interest and awareness of computer science in local schools.

        Code Haven’s mission is to inclusively increase access to computer
        science education in local middle schools. Our team of over 50 mentors
        teaches hour-long lessons on computer science principles, writing
        programs in Scratch, and building functional apps at the end of the
        year. We work to foster a supportive environment where students aren’t
        afraid to ask questions about a subject area most haven’t been exposed
        to before our curriculum.

        We work with local middle schools in New Haven, Connecticut. Our
        students come from all sorts of backgrounds, and many do not have
        experience with computer science since it tends to be left out of the
        required state curriculum. We are also expanding our reach by making our curriculum available online: check it out by clicking on "Curriculum" in the navigation bar!

        Code Haven hosts multiple events throughout the year for students and
        teachers. In the fall, we host Demo Day to show our students the world
        of computer science through talks and activities. In the winter, we host
        TeachTech to equip teachers around the New Haven area with the tools to
        teach computer science. In the spring, we hold Project Fair, so all of
        the students can share their functional mobile apps with their
        classmates, teachers, and parents!

        Our year-long curriculum is meant for students who have no previous
        background in computer science. During the first semester, we introduce
        students to CS concepts like conditionals, loops, and variables. Our
        interactive lectures are supplemented with “Unplugged Activities” (fun
        exercises that don't require a computer) and plenty of time for students
        to code on their own. Our second semester is project-based, and students
        design and create their own Android apps, like Mario Chase or a photo
        editor.
