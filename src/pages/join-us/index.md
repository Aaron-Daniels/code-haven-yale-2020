# For Yale Students: Become a Mentor!

Interested in becoming a mentor, role model, leader, and teacher for students in New Haven? We take on new members at the start of every semester, and our onboarding process is quick and painless. We’ll just ask that you sit down for a short interview to get to know you, and then attend a workshop to help prepare you for the classroom. No prior teaching experience is necessary -- only patience, the willingness to learn, and an interest in our goals! Also, don't worry if you don't have formal computer science experience!

Plus, as a member, you’ll be able to:
  -  Gain confidence in your programming skills by teaching children!
  -  Give back to the New Haven community
  -  Meet other Yale students interested in Computer Science
  -  Get t-shirts, stickers, tote bags, and more!

If any of this sounds interesting to you, email us at codehavenyale \[at\] gmail.com!

# For Teachers: Bring Code Haven to Your Classroom!
Interested in bringing introductory computer science to your classroom? Our current curriculum is designed for middle school students with no computer science experiences, with lessons for an hour a week. We've filled all our classroom slots for the 2019-2020 school year, but please get in touch by emailing us at codehavenyale \[at\] gmail.com!
