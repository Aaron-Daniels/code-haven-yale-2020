# Code Haven Yale

Information: 
- Site is deployed with Netlify, which also powers the form.
- Pages are generated using GatsbyJS, which gets data from markdown files.

## How to add pages

First, create a new folder and corresponding `index.md` file in the `src/pages` directory. This will be the content of your page, and the other parts of the website draw from this markdown file, whether from the front-matter or the content itself. 

Secondly, create the relevant template file in `src/templates`. Edit the query to draw from relevant fields in the markdown file, and import any components you would like from `src/components`.
